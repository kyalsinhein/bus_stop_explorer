Bristol Bus Explorer is a web-based application designed to help commuters and travelers navigate the bus network in Bristol with ease. The app provides information about bus routes, stops, schedules, and travel planning, making it easier for users to plan their journeys in the city.

The main idea behind the project was to create a tool that saves time and reduces confusion for people relying on public transport. Instead of checking multiple websites or waiting at stops, users can quickly find the route they need, view nearby stops on a map, and get estimated travel times.
